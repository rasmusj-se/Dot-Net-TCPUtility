## TCP Utility written in C#. 

Support both encrypted and non encrypted communication, full duplex and multiple clients. 
Uses eventhandlers to announce connected client or incoming message, very easy to use. 

`This project is not maintained.`

##### Compiled download can be found at https://rtek.se/TCPUtility.dll, dll is ready to use as is.

Check the simple chat server example for usage. 

Everything you need is contained within the two class files TCPClient.cs and TCPServer.cs in TCPUtility. A better documentation will be added soon, for now just check the examples. Target .NET framework is 4.6 but it probably runs well on 4.0 as well though not tested.

Note: This is a very new project (ie. some ugly code and not very well documented nor tested)
