##TCP Utility written in C#. 

Support both encrypted and non encrypted communication, full duplex and multiple clients. 
Uses eventhandlers to announce connected client or incoming message, very easy to use. 
See simple chat server example for usage. Everything you need is contained within the two class files TCPClient.cs and TCPServer.cs in TCPUtility. A better documentation will be added soon, for now just check the examples.
